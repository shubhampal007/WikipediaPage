            </div>
            <div class="description-nav1" >
                <p>C++ is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language. It was created by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs circa 1980. C++ is very similar to C (invented by Dennis Ritchie in the early 1970s). C++ is so compatible with C that it will probably compile over 99% of C programs without changing a line of source code. Though C++ is a lot of well-structured and safer language than C as it OOPs based.

                <p>Some computer languages are written for a specific purpose. Like, Java was initially devised to control toasters and some other electronics. C was developed for programming OS. Pascal was conceptualized to teach proper programming techniques. But C++ is a general-purpose language. It well deserves the widely acknowledged nickname “Swiss Pocket Knife of Languages.”</p>

                        cout << "Hello World!";<br>
                        return 0;<br>
                    }</p>

                <h3>Objects and Classes</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="description-nav2">
               <p> In C++, Object is a real world entity, for example, chair, car, pen, mobile, laptop etc. In other words, object is an entity that has state and behavior. Here, state means data and behavior means functionality. Object is a runtime entity, it is created at runtime.
    
               </p>
               <p>Class: A class in C++ is the building block that leads to Object-Oriented programming. It is a user-defined data type, which holds its own data members and member functions, which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class. A C++ class is like a blueprint for an object. For Example: Consider the Class of Cars. There may be many cars with different names and brand but all of them will share some common properties like all of them will have 4 wheels, Speed Limit, Mileage range etc. So here, Car is the class and wheels, speed limits, mileage are their properties.
    
                A Class is a user defined data-type which has data members and member functions.
                Data members are the data variables and member functions are the functions used to manipulate these variables and together these data members and member functions defines the properties and behavior of the objects in a Class.
                In the above example of class Car, the data member will be speed limit, mileage etc and member functions can be apply brakes, increase speed etc.
                An Object is an instance of a Class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated (i.e. an object is created) memory is allocated.</p>
                <p>C++ is an object-oriented programming language.
    
                    Everything in C++ is associated with classes and objects, along with its attributes and methods. For example: in real life, a car is an object. The car has attributes, such as weight and color, and methods, such as drive and brake.
                    
                    Attributes and methods are basically variables and functions that belongs to the class. These are often referred to as "class members".
                    
                    A class is a user-defined data type that we can use in our program, and it works as an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.</p>

                <h3>Inheritance</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="description-nav3">
                <p>Inheritance is a feature or a process in which, new classes are created from the existing classes. The new class created is called “derived class” or “child class” and the existing class is known as the “base class” or “parent class”. The derived class now is said to be inherited from the base class.</p>
                <p>o When a base class is privately inherited by the derived class, public members of the base class becomes the private members of the derived class and therefore, the public members of the base class can only be accessed by the member functions of the derived class. They are inaccessible to the objects of the derived class.
                    o On the other hand, when the base class is publicly inherited by the derived class, public members of the base class also become the public members of the derived class. Therefore, the public members of the base class are accessible by the objects of the derived class as well as by the member functions of the derived class.

                <h3>Polymorphism</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="description-nav4">
                <p>Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when w    e have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance. Like we specified in the previous chapter; Inheritance lets us inherit attributes and methods from another class. Polymorphism uses those methods to perform different tasks.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="heading-nav5" id="heading-nav5">
                <h3>Abstraction</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="description-nav5">
                <p>Abstraction means displaying only essential information and hiding the details. Data abstraction refers to providing only essential information about the data to the outside world, hiding the background details or implementation.</p>
    
            </div>
            <div class="heading-nav6" id="heading-nav6">
                <h3>Encapsulation</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="description-nav6">
                <p>Encapsulation in C++ is defined as the wrapping up of data and information in a single unit. In Object Oriented Programming, Encapsulation is defined as binding together the data and the functions that manipulate them.</p>
